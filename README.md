# netflix-clone

A Netflix design clone was created through this project. The design has a dynamic structure. You can scroll up and down the page with ListView, and you can scroll sideways with MovieView. It was created using BlocPattern technology. It is also possible to add ElevatedButtons to the project to allow switching between pages.
